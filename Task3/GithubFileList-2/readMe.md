In real applications, youâ€™ll want to have only one component per file most
of the time. Sometimes a file will contain a few related components, when
those components are always used together (as in the Nav / NavItem example
from earlier), but otherwise they should be separated out. Refactor the code
from Exercise 1 to pull out components into separate files, using import and
export.
