Make a component to display an “error box” that looks like this:  

Invoking the component should look like this:  

`<ErrorBox>`  
Something has gone wrong  
`</ErrorBox>`  

Use the `children` prop to place the text properly. The image above 
uses *Bootstrap* for styling and *Font Awesome* for the icon. You can add these
libraries to your public/index.html file for the styling icon if you like.
